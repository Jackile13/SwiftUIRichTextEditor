# SwiftUIRichTextEditor
This is a demonstration of using the UITextView from UIKit in SwiftUI via UIViewRepresentable. This allows for rich text editing functionality in a SwiftUI app.
This app demonstrates being able to toggle bold/underline/italics on selected text or new text being typed in.
Other text attributes are available and can easily be applied to the NSAttributedString binding property.
